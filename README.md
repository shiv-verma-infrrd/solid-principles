# SOLID Principles

## Overview

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that guide software development to ensure systems are well-structured, maintainable, and scalable. These principles are foundational for building robust object-oriented systems and enhancing code quality.

## Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single job or responsibility.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (such as classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows new functionality to be added without altering existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Prefer creating smaller, specific interfaces over a large, general-purpose one.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

## Benefits

- **Maintainability:** Simplifies code management and modification.
- **Scalability:** Eases the addition of new features.
- **Testability:** Enhances the ability to unit test components.
