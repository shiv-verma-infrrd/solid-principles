Overview
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help create well-structured, maintainable, and scalable software. These principles are crucial for building robust object-oriented systems and improving code quality.

Principles
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows you to add new functionality without changing existing code.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. This means creating specific, smaller interfaces rather than a large, general-purpose one.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
Benefits
Maintainability: Easier to manage and modify code.
Scalability: Facilitates the addition of new features.
Testability: Improves the ease of unit testing components.
